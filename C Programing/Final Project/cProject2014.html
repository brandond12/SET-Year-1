<h1>C Programming - Project - Fall 2014</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Write a program that wraps lines from a text file at a certain column position.</p>
<h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
<p>The description of how the command should work is found separately in this dropbox at cProject_wrapfile_2014.html.&#160; </p>
<ul>
<li>In the description, anything in square brackets indicates optional items. Italicized items are required items but the words used represent something (e.g. &quot;<em>file</em>&quot; means that you need to have the name of a file). Three dots (&quot;...&quot;) represents one or more of the preceding item (e.g. &quot;<em>file ...</em>&quot; means one or more filenames).
<ul>
<li>This is a common standard for the description of a command.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is no guarantee that files mentioned on the command line actually exist.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Restrictions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do not use global variables or goto.&#160;</li>
<li>All code that you use must be your own. Deviating from this could result in a mark of 0.</li>
<li>Do not use exit().&#160; Exit statuses must be handled by returning the value from main().</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug List Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>You must create (and submit) a file called bugs.docx (or bugs.doc).</li>
<li>The top heading of the first page must state &quot;Project Bug List for &quot; and then state your full name.</li>
<li>This file will contain a bullet list of all bugs and missing requirements that you know of in your submitted program.
<ul>
<li>The list should be specific and easy to understand.</li>
<li>If you have no bugs and no missing requirements that you know of, simply state &quot;This project is complete.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>10 marks of your total Project mark will be assigned to this requirement. The completeness and quality of the file will determine this mark.
<ul>
<li>In addition, the penalties associated with bugs or missing requirements might be lessened if they are described in this file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>File Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Call the executable wrapfile.exe (to be renamed to wrapfile.x upon submission to the dropbox).</li>
<li>Call the file that contains your main() function wrapfile.c.</li>
<li>You can create other source files if you wish but the filenames should make the contents of the file clear.
<ul>
<li>All source files must have header comments. The description in all files except wrapfile.c must describe the contents of the file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Put all required files in the eConestoga Project dropbox.</li>
<li>Hand in all source code and the executable.
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you don&#39;t mess up on this, as it&#39;ll be too late to correct it afterwards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Late Penalties</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pinky bucks are not allowed.</li>
<li>You can hand in the project one day late at a 20% penalty.</li>
<li>You cannot hand the project in more than one day late.</li>
</ul>
